/// Scope
/// -----
/// **Rest to rest only.** Both endpoints have zero velocity and zero
/// acceleration. Planning from a non-zero initial state is a genuinely harder
/// problem -- the profile stops being symmetric, deceleration can have to begin
/// before acceleration finishes, and there are states from which the goal is
/// only reachable by overshooting it first. Ruckig solves that problem
/// properly; this class solves the one industrial point-to-point motion
/// actually poses, and says so rather than implying the general case is covered.
///
/// Shape
/// -----
/// Seven segments of constant jerk: `+J, 0, -J, 0, -J, 0, +J`. The middle
/// segment is the constant-velocity cruise; the two zero-jerk segments beside
/// it are constant-acceleration plateaus. A short move loses the cruise; a
/// short move against a high acceleration limit loses the plateaus as well and
/// never reaches max_acceleration. All three shapes come out of one
/// construction, with the unused segments at zero duration.
///
/// Sampling
/// --------
/// sample() evaluates the closed form for the segment containing `t`, starting
/// from state stored at that segment's entry. It is O(1), allocation-free and
/// noexcept, so it is callable from the cyclic task.
///
/// **Sample it; do not integrate it.** Feeding velocity into an integrator at
/// the control rate accumulates truncation error that closed-form sampling does
/// not have. At 1 kHz forward Euler lands visibly short of the goal; the figure
/// is measured in TrajectorySampling.EulerIntegrationDriftsWhereSamplingDoesNot.

///     q_i(t) = q_i(0) + dq_i * s(t)
